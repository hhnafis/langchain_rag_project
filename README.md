# langchain_rag_project
This project implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, Pinecone, and Google's Gemini API.  It processes a text document ("AI.txt"), splits it into chunks, embeds those chunks using Google Gemini embeddings, and stores them in a Pinecone vector database.
